## Customization
The app configuration is placed in `app_config.gradle` file. There you can change application ID, version info, network params, colors, and features availability.

Besides the main configuration file there are also `stage_app_config.gradle` for the staging build type and `release_app_config.gradle` for the release one. There you can override particular properties from the main configuration.
You can also write a configuration for the debug build type into `dev_app_config.gradle` file which is ignored by Git.

### Network config
The configuration contains 5 fields that represent network params of a specific TokenD-based system:
 `api_url`, `storage_url`, `web_client_url`, `terms_url`, `kyc_url` and `app_host`.

The app allows user to specify a TokenD-based system to work with by scanning a QR code with network params. In this case, network params from the configuration will be used and displayed by default.

To disable system switching you have to set `network_specified_by_user` flag to false. With fixed network config you can also enable opening links from emails in the app by specifying system domain in `app_host` field and uncommenting intent filters in manifest.

### Analytics
The application is ready for Firebase analytics and crashlytics integration.
To enable it you have to create Firebase project and put `google-services.json` file (it is already gitignored)
into the `app/` directory.
To enable or disable analytics use `enable_analytics` flag. In the default configuration this flag is enabled for staging and release builds.

### Branding
In order to change the application branding you have to update following resources:

* `product_logo` in `mipmap` – logo used on the splash screen and in the navigation header
* `ic_launcher` in `mipmap` – legacy application icon
* `ic_launcher_background` and `ic_launcher_foreground` in `drawable-v24` – parts of the adaptive icon displayed on Android 7.0 and higher
* `app_name` field in `strings.xml` – displayed application name

## Testing
There are integration tests for use cases in `src/test/java/org/tokend/template/test`.
You can specify the environment to run tests on inside `Config.kt` file. 

It is recommended to use local [TokenD Developer edition](https://github.com/tokend/developer-edition)
for tests because they create a lot of users, assets, asset pairs, etc.

## Connecting to Developer edition
In order to connect the wallet to your [TokenD Developer edition](https://github.com/tokend/developer-edition) instance follow [this guide](https://mobile-qr.tokend.services/).
